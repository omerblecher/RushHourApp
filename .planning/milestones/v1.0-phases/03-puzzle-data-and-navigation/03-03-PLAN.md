User performs the following verification steps:
1. Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173/
2. **Main Menu:** Verify title and Play button. Click Play.
3. **Puzzle Select:** Verify Beginner tab is selected by default. See 20+ numbered puzzle tiles in a grid.
4. **Difficulty Tabs:** Click each tab (Intermediate, Advanced, Expert, back to Beginner). Verify grid updates. Verify browser back button does NOT undo tab switches.
5. **Play a Puzzle:** Click any Beginner puzzle tile. Verify game board loads with the correct puzzle. Verify URL shows `/play/beginner/beginner-NN`.
6. **Gameplay:** Drag vehicles to solve the puzzle. Verify existing Phase 2 drag/collision/snap still works.
7. **Win Modal:** After solving, verify modal shows your moves, minimum moves, and your time. If moves === minMoves, verify "Optimal!" indicator.
8. **Next Puzzle:** Click "Next Puzzle" — verify next puzzle in same difficulty loads.
9. **Back to Selection:** On win modal, click "Back to Selection" — verify return to puzzle grid with correct difficulty tab.
10. **Completion Status:** In puzzle grid, verify the solved puzzle now shows a checkmark overlay.
11. **Persistence:** Refresh the page. Navigate back to puzzle grid. Verify checkmark is still present (localStorage).
12. **Direct URL:** Type `http://localhost:5173/play/beginner/beginner-01` directly — verify it loads (SPA routing works).
13. **Leaderboard Stub:** Navigate to `/leaderboard/beginner/beginner-01` — verify stub page renders.
14. **ControlBar Back:** During gameplay, click Back button in ControlBar — verify navigates to previous screen.
