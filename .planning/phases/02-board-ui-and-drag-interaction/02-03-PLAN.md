<objective>
Human verification of the complete Phase 2 game board UI and drag interaction.

Purpose: Confirm all visual design, drag behavior, responsiveness, and game controls meet the user's vision before proceeding to Phase 3.
Output: User approval or a list of issues to address.

  <name>Task 1: Verify complete board UI and drag interaction</name>
  <what-built>
Complete Phase 2: Visual game board with CSS-styled vehicles, pointer-event drag system, collision prevention, snap-to-grid, HUD with move counter and timer, and undo/reset controls. Built on top of the Phase 1 game engine.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Start the dev server: `npm run dev`

**Visual Design (look and feel):**
1. Board should look like a toy board game — dark border/frame, visible grid cell tiles, playful colors
2. Vehicles should be pill-shaped with 3D shadows and gradients
3. Cars (2-cell) should have window/headlight details via CSS
4. Trucks (3-cell) should have cargo/panel details
5. Red target car (X) should stand out with special flair (glow/shine)
6. Exit marker should be visible as a gap/cutout on the right side at row 3
7. Background should have a subtle pattern/texture (dots or similar)
8. 12+ distinct vehicle colors should be visible

**Drag Interaction:**
9. Click and drag any vehicle — it should follow pointer along its axis only
10. Drag toward another vehicle — should stop at the collision boundary (hard stop)
11. Release mid-cell — vehicle should snap to nearest grid cell with smooth animation
12. During drag: vehicle should lift (scale up slightly, gain shadow)
13. Hover over a vehicle — subtle highlight should appear
14. The drag should feel smooth (60fps, no jank)

**Touch (test in Chrome DevTools device mode or real device):**
15. Toggle device emulation (Ctrl+Shift+M) to a mobile device
16. Touch-drag a vehicle — same axis constraint and collision behavior

**HUD and Controls:**
17. Above board: move counter ("Moves: 0 / 8 min") and timer (0:00)
18. Drag a vehicle — move counter increments, timer starts
19. Below board: Undo, Reset, and Back buttons
20. Click Undo — last move is reversed
21. Click Reset — puzzle returns to initial state, counter and timer reset
22. Undo disabled when no moves made; Reset disabled when counter is 0

**Responsiveness:**
23. Resize browser to 320px width — board should shrink and stay square
24. Resize to full desktop — board should size up (max ~480px)
